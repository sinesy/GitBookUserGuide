# Constraint panel

> Since 6.0.0

A constraint panel can contains multiple panels, you can anchor panels freely using constraints. If you have many panels you could for example place a constraint panel in the center of the window and add all the other panels here, or you can combine the border layout and the constraint panels.

![This is an example.](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png>)

You can specify the constraints for each panel inside a constraint panel, use the Layout Constraint folder.

You can also change the constraints runtime using the specific API, see the Javascript API docs.
