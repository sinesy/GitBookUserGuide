# An example

## From theory to practise

Now it is time to move from theory to a real example of how to manage processes through 4WS.Platform, which makes it possible to graphically design a business process and monitor its execution, step by step, until its end.

Letâ€™s start from the Administration -&gt; Activiti menu available in the 4WS.Platform App Designer. This menu is composed of these functionalities, all related to the BPM management:

* [Processes](ee0-6-2-processes.md)
* [Instances](ee0-6-3-instances.md)
* [Activities](ee0-6-4-activities.md)
* [History](ee0-6-5-history.md)
