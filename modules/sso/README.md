# SSO

4WS.Platform supports external/SSO/federated SSO authentication mechanisms, that hold usernames and passwords and let the credential to be stored in a central system, without replication. Anyway, to make 4WS.Platform work correctly the users and roles must be synchronized or provisioned.  
The following authentication providers are currently available:

* [Identity management in Platform](ee6-1-identity-management-in-platform/)
* [external LDAP or Active Directory](ldap/)
* [Google SSO](google-sso/)
* [Custom SSO](custom-sso.md)
