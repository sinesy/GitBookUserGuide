# Multi Value Combobox Filter

The multi value combobox filter is a control available in the filter and editable panels. This control can filter the associated grid for one column and multiple values.

If the control is used in a filter panel the grid it refers is the same as specified for the panel.

In an editable panel you can apply the filter with a javascript action using the data selected in the control.

#### Configuration

You can configure the control in the Input Controls folder \(Dynamic Combobox\) and associate the selector  with the Multi Value properties selected.
