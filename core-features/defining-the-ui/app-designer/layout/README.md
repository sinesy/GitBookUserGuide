**Panel containers and layouts**  
Platform supports a variety of different **panel containers** , each managing the layout of its children panels in a different way:

* [tab panel](tab-panel.md)

* [accordion panel](accordion-panel.md)
* [vertical orientation panel](vertical-orientation-panel.md)
* [horizontal orientation panel](horizontal-orientation-panel.md)

* [generic panel](ggeneric-panel.md)
* [responsive panel](responsive-panel.md)

Each of them is described as follow.  
Note: you can easily change the current panel container with another one, without having to remove its content and then remove it: the commands “Replace this panel with…” allow you to replace the current panel container with any other.
